# California-Housing-Prices-prediction-and-data-analysis
This project predicts California housing prices using XGBoost and Linear Regression. The dataset includes features like median income, house age, population, and location to estimate housing prices.

ðŸ”¹ Features & Techniques:

âœ” Data Preprocessing â€“ Handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding.

âœ” Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“ Visualizing feature distributions and correlations.

âœ” Modeling â€“ Compared XGBoost vs. Polynomial Ridge Regression with hyperparameter tuning.

âœ” Evaluation â€“ Used RÂ² score and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to assess model performance.

âœ” Hyperparameter Tuning â€“ Implemented GridSearchCV & Early Stopping for optimization.


ðŸš€ Key Findings:

ðŸ“Œ XGBoost outperformed Linear Regression, handling non-linearity better.

ðŸ“Œ Ridge Regression underfitted the dataset, indicating a non-linear relationship.

ðŸ“Œ Feature importance analysis revealed median income as the strongest predictor.


ðŸ”— Next Steps:

ðŸ”¹ Experiment with feature engineering & additional ML models.

ðŸ”¹ Deploy the model using a Flask or FastAPI web service.


ðŸ“‚ Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
